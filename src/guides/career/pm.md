So what in the world is PM? Besides the ambiguity of what the "P" stands for (Product? Program?? Project???), the role itself is amorphous and can cover various responsibilities, depending on the company and team. But what's important to take away is that being a PM means you're gonna wear a lot of different hats.

## The Job
* Overview: connect Tech, Business, Design, Audience
* examples of how you may cater to each party
* Effectively: drive a product (or program or project) to its next stage (whether that's MVP or feature-based or expanding UX) by coordinating those parties

### Company-Specific
* MS
* Google
* Facebook
* Amazon
* LinkedIn?
* Anywhere else
* Distinguish PM/PgM/PjM

## Skills Needed
* When you code, what are you passionate about? For me, it wasn't the efficiency of the best alg possible in my code -- it was imagining how people would use what I built. 
* Unlike CS, not straightforward in terms of technical interview
* A lot to do with how you think about things (i.e. a product is never finished, seeing the bigger pic + key details, etc.)
* Organization
* Communication (but introverts, don't despair!)
* Time management
* Ruthless prioritization
* Leadership
* Scrappy to get a product going / off the ground
* User-focused
* Willing to do the legwork
* Business -- some acumen / bringing something to market, MBA
* Technical -- SWE experience is often a big plus and gets you respect, but not a requirement
* But you do have to be able to keep up with the technical concepts your product involves

## Interviewing
* Refer to Cracking the PM Interview
* Case studies
* Lots of behavioral
* Be able to talk about your past experiences in a PM light (conducted user studies, brought teammates together, delegated work according to a timetable, self-managed projects, anything)
* Expect to be asked Qs based on what your resume doesn't reflect (e.g. CS major with SWE internships = business Qs, behavioral)
* Estimation Qs
* Hypothetical design Qs

## Paths to PM
* Literally anything (ChemE PhD, high school math teacher, business side, engineering side, etc.)
* CS major (since y'all are on this wiki...) = some years of SWE experience --> mgmt position --> PM transition, but also plenty get that "kick" from mgmt and that's perfectly fine

## Final Notes
* CS major will lend itself greatly to the role, but not the only path forward
* Getting respect in the CS world
* I had a really hard time figuring out what I wanted to do -- switching majors, being non-committal. But it wasn't because I wasn't passionate, it was because I felt like I was missing out by focusing too hard on any one thing. With PM, I get to touch a different part of a whole product development life cycle, so I get my aesthetic / UI kick, flex my technical chops, analyze business value, and my favorite -- build for an audience and hear their feedback. It's a dynamic role, and if you ask any PM what their typical day is like, they won't have a straight answer.
